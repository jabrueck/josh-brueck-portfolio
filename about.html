		<h1>A little about me</h1>
		<p>I am a front end web designer looking to convert into more of a developer role. I enjoy good food, strong coffee and hoppy libations. I love technology and gadgets and I'm a bit if a pop culture geek. </p>
		<p>I currently work for a small company that provides web services and advertising solutions to grocery chains throughout the country. We work on using new methods and technology to deliver their content to a wider audience engaging through different mediums while trying to remain a valuable source of information to their traditional and long standing client base.</p>
		<p>A great work/life balnce is something I have come to value very highly. I enjoy working with technology and people who want to have fun and still excell at their craft, but since I recently became a father I also value the time spent with family.</p>

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Communications from Bowling Green State University and I also received a Professional Certification in Web Design from The University of Cincinnati.</p>
